> ### this is the alternative Hangman game

**You can enjoy here:** https://chonnikan-aue-spaceman.netlify.app/



## Technologies used

- **For designing wire frames:** [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)

- **For game web:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5.2

- **For API:** [Random Word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home)

- **For connect API:** Axios

- **For deployment:** Netlify  



## Installation instructions

I recommend lastest version of Chrome browser in desktop to play the game



## Planning

> ### User Stories

- As a player, guess the word before spaceship completely drawn.

- Have 8 spaceship part = 8 wrong guesses (body, head, window, first wing, second wing, third wing, nozzle, fire)

- Have alphabet button as a keyboard in UI to select guessed alphabet.

- Alphabet button cannot click when already guessed

> ### MVP Goals

- Timer-based scoring, have initial time (5 minutes)

- In singleplayer mode, game web will random word from Random Word API

- Have scoreboard for singleplayer mode, player can type their name and save score to local storage (this will not save to other browsers)

- Score will calculate from:

  - Time Left (in centisecond)

  - length of word that correctly guess (+5000 for each alphabet)

  - when wrong guessed (-1000 for each alphabet)

  - Time's up (-1000)
  
> ### Stretch Goals

**First Priority**

- Have singleplayer mode and multiplayer mode

- In multiplayer mode, each player have different word (random from API) and separated game window but in the same timer

- Have scoreboard for multiplayer mode 

**Second Priority**

- Have background sound and SFX sound effects

- Can mute background sound and SFX sound effects

**Third Priority**

- Can change theme to other images instead of spaceship, such as snowman
